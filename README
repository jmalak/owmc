This is a port of the Wine messsage compiler (wmc) to Open Watcom.
Like the binutils windmc, it serves as an alternative to the Visual Studio MC.exe.

The sources were imported from Wine release 1.5.22 and the first port is simply a copy of wmc and
the required objects from libwine and libport with minor source code changes. If the Open Watcom (v2)
compiler already contains the needed header (either in "h", "h/nt" or "h/win"), the wine-provided header
is deleted.

The licensing is thus also (L)GPL just like the parent project.


TODO:
* slim down:
Many functions provided by the wine library files will be duplicates of functions provided by the
Watcom C-library. The aim is to slim down the port as much as possible by changing the source to use the Watcom
C-library functions and delete as much as possible of the Wine library provided functions.
* test
The port needs to be "battle hardened". Hopefully various watcom users will find this useful and get it in a better shape.
* upstream?
It would be awesome if the upstream Open Watcom (v2) would include a messsage compiler. If this would become acceptable, that would be cool.


To build:
cd to libport, run wmake, move libport.lib to source root
cd to libwine, run wmake, move libwine.lib to source root
(ok silly I know, but I am not familiar with how Windows handles directories)
run wmake in source root
- todo: make building the libraries an automatic part of the source root makefile.

To install, simply copy the resulting binary to $WATCOM\binnt
($WATCOM = install root of Open Watcom, for example C:\WATCOM)
